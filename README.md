HTML: Stand for Hypertext markup language
```
It is markup language that we use to communicate with browser the kind of element to display. 
You can create webpages  with HTML too :relaxed:
**Markup language** is a language that uses tags aka angle brackect <> to describe element.
So, HTML is language thats uses tags to tell the browser to structure certain elements. 
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<title>HTML Tutorial</title>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
